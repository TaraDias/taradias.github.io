   duct-tape> ***** INTERVIEW MODE ON *****
   <br>
> hehheheheheh
<br>
> tell me about greenday :)
<br>
* duct-tape giggles.
<br>
duct-tape> Well, I like them, in general...
<br>
duct-tape> I prefer the old stuff, of course.
<br>
duct-tape> Slappy, 1000 hours, kerplunk, etc.
<br>
duct-tape> Dookie has its brief moments..
<br>
duct-tape> I haven't heard the whole of their new album.
<br> 
>what about greenday "selling out"
<br>
duct-tape> Well, i mean, I think they did sell out to an extent,
<br>

duct-tape> though there's still some remnants of the way they were..
<br>
duct-tape> like that song "Walking Contradiction" on the new album..
<br>
duct-tape> that song is very old-skool green day
<br>
duct-tape> but otherwise, I feel that they're just pop musicians
    with a lot of distortion who act like punx.
    <br>
> ok..
> now what about punk rock in general
<br>
> and its ride to the mainstream
<br>
duct-tape> Well..
<br>
duct-tape> I feel that punk has taken a turn for the worse, becoming
<br>
    mainstream and all...
duct-tape> That the old punk values have kind of been lost.
<br>
duct-tape> Which isn't the fault of punx themselves,
<br>
duct-tape> but of mainstream culture...
<br>
duct-tape> I mean, since bands such as Nirvana popularized a more
    punk sound,
    <br>
duct-tape> even cock-rock morons have jumped on the punk bandwagon.
duct-tape> And that's just not cool.
<br>
> now completely off track...
duct-tape> fine with me.
<br>
> whats the best movie youve seen lately.. (doesnt have to be a new release)
duct-tape> Braveheart.
<br>
> really?
<br>
> braveheart?
<br>
duct-tape> Oh yes.
<br>
duct-tape> That movie is amazing.
<br>
> why?
<br>
> a bunch of guys running aorund in skirts?
<br>
> :)
<br>
duct-tape> haha.
<br>
duct-tape> Really, the story, the acting, it's all amazing.
<br>
duct-tape> it made me cry.
<br>
> ok, on that line...
<br>

> is it alright for men to cry?
<br>
> and if so/if not....
<br>
> when and why not/ why...
<br>
duct-tape> Damn straight.
<br>
duct-tape> I mean, that idea that men aren't supposed to crybecause
    they're supposed to be "strong", that's complete bullshit...
    <br>
duct-tape> If I need to cry, I'm going to do it.
> why is it bullshit?
<br>
duct-tape> It's a stereotype of males...
<br>
> is it alright for men to cry around women?
<br>
> and especially a significant other?
<br>
duct-tape> of course!
<br>
duct-tape> I encourage it.
<br>
duct-tape> I mean, if you're feeling weak, don't pretend to be
   strong, no matter who the person is, because it will just build up
    inside and end up hurting a lot.
    <br>
> what do you think of rap?
<br>
duct-tape> I love rap.
<br>
duct-tape> rap is some phat shit.
<br>
 >what about gangsta rap?
 <br>
duct-tape> Well, some of the beatz can be cool, but the lyrics and the
    message, not cool at all.
<br>
> anything else you wanna say before i cut you off?
<br>
duct-tape> I'll just leave you with one of my favorite quotes...
<br>
duct-tape> It's from Michael Stipe, at an R.E.M. concert back in 1986.
<br>
duct-tape> "I pledge allegiance to no flag.  If I pledge allegiance,
    and I do, it's to a flag that I made, out of cloth, that I like.  I
    pledge allegiance to the ground I stand on."
    <br>
duct-tape> That's it.
