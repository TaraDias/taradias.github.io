          ideally, BUCKET will acquire some consistent writers and will expand to be released twice a month at about <span class="l-40k popup-link">40k</span>.  right now, expect monthly releases between <span class="l-25k popup-link">25k</span> and <span class="l-30k popup-link">30k</span>, growing as we grow.
